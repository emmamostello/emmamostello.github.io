    <p>Lana Del Rey, born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, was born on June 21, 1985 in Manhattan, New York City. After highschool, Grant started working as a waitress and learned how to play the guitar. She than began to start playing in bars and nightclubs in New York City around Brooklyn under her stage name Sparkle Jump Rope Queen. At 19, Grant started college at Fordham University in New York City where she studied philosophy. While at her senior year at Fordham, she submitted a demo tape to 5 Points Records, where she was offered a $10,000 contract. With the money she got from the recording contract, she moved to a trailer park in New Jersey where she worked on her EP "Kill Kill". Grant later chose her famous stage name, Lana Del Rey, when she was inspired by actress Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey sudan, while also being inspired by the city of Miami.</p>

    <p>In January 2010, Del Rey released her first studio album, titled, Lana Del Rey, where her father helped her with the marketing of the album. Later in 2011, she posted music videos on YoutTube for her songs "Video Games" and "Blue Jeans", which went viral and led to her being signed by Stranger Records, later signing a joint deal with Interscope Records, where she released "Video Games" as her debut single. On January 31, 2012, Lana released her second studio album, "Born to Die", which debuted at the number two spot on the Billboard 200 album chart. Over the next 11 years, Lana Del Rey went on to make and release seven more albums. </p>

        <p>Del Rey cites a wide array of musical artists as influences, including numerous pop, jazz, and blues performers from the mid-twentieth century, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber,[222] Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Bobby Vinton,[223] The Crystals,[223] and Miles Davis.[224] Torch singers Julie London[225] and Julee Cruise have also served as influences.[223] "[I really] just like the masters of every genre", she told BBC radio presenter Jo Whiley in 2012, specifically naming Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley.[226] Several rock and pop musicians and groups from the late-twentieth century have also inspired Del Rey, such as Bruce Springsteen,[227] Britney Spears,[228] singer-songwriter Lou Reed, and rock band the Eagles, as well as folk musicians such as Leonard Cohen[223] and Joan Baez. Del Rey has also cited contemporary artists, such as singer-songwriter Cat Power,[227] Hole frontwoman Courtney Love,[229] rapper Eminem, and singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse as artists she looked up to.[223] Del Rey has cited the soundtrack to American Beauty as a partial inspiration for her album Born to Die (2012). Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting.[231][232] Del Rey has cited film directors, David Lynch and Federico Fellini, and painters, Mark Ryden and Pablo Picasso, as influences[212][233] and has stated actress Lauren Bacall is someone she admires. Del Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which spans three-plus octaves and has been described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging with great ease from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy ornaments in her lower register.[235] Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics increasingly appreciated Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive delivery.[236] When recording in the studio, Del Rey is known for vocal multi-layering, which, as it has been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of backing singers to fill out the original vocal style.[237] Stage fright has also been noted as a major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances;[238] however, journalists noted in 2014 her live performances had increased in confidence. Billboard deemed the Coachella debut of "West Coast" to be a "star-making performance" and lauded the singer's vocal abilities.[239][240] Contemporary music critics have called her voice "smoky",[241] "gravelly",[220] and reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe.[220] Upon the 2015 release of Honeymoon, her voice was compared by Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood to those of Julee Cruise and Eartha Kitt. Del Rey began using lower vocals with Born to Die, claiming "people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway".[243] "I sing low now, but my voice used to be a lot higher. Because of the way I look, I needed something to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to", she said on the topic.[24]</p>

        <img src="../img/LDRselftittled.jpg" alt="Lana Del Rey Self titled album cover" width="400" height="400">
        <p>Lana Del Rey is Lana Del Rey's first studio album, released in January 4, 2010. When Lana released this album, she was under 5 Points Records, and the label removed debut album from retailers. Lana later bought the rights back to her self-titled debut album; however, she has never rereleased the album, which is why it is absent from streaming platforms. Del Rey and producer David Kahne recorded 13 tracks for the album throughout 2008.[15] Instead of immediately releasing the full material, her label put out three of the tracks from the album sessions through a promotional EP titled Kill Kill on October 21, 2008, under the name Lizzy Grant.[16] The EP was a critical success, with critics calling it poetic and elegant and the album led to Del Rey being featured as an emerging artist.[17] Between the release of Kill Kill and the album, Del Rey expressed the desire to change her name. While on a trip to Miami, Del Rey was speaking Spanish with a few of her friends from Cuba, when they landed on "Lana Del Rey". Inspired by Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan, the name reminded Del Rey and her friends of what she called the glamour of the seaside. "It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue" she said.[18] Del Rey at the time opted for the alternate spelling, by spelling it R-A-Y.</p>

        <p>Born to Die is the debut major label studio album and second studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. It was released on January 27, 2012, through Interscope Records and Polydor Records. A reissue of the album, subtitled The Paradise Edition, was released on November 9, 2012. The new material from the reissue was also made available on a separate EP, titled Paradise. Before the album's release, Del Rey had attracted attention with her 2011 singles "Video Games" and "Born to Die", which contrasted contemporary electronic/dance music with their cinematic sound accompanied by dramatic string instruments. A predominantly baroque pop and trip hop album, Born to Die features the same cinematic composition. The lyrics are about love, sex, and drugs, and feature prominent references to 1950s and 1960s Americana. The album was the world's fifth best-selling album of 2012, and had sold over 7 million copies by 2014. In 2021, it became the second album by a woman to spend more than 400 weeks on the US Billboard 200, where it peaked at number two, and topped charts in Australia and various European countries including France, Germany, and the UK.</p>

        <img src="../img/Ultraviolence.jpg" alt="Lana Del Rey Ultraviolence album cover" width="400" height="400">
        <p>Ultraviolence is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, released on June 13, 2014, by Polydor and Interscope Records. Originally dismissing the possibility of releasing another record after her major-label debut Born to Die (2012), Del Rey began planning its follow-up in 2013. Production continued into 2014, at which time she heavily collaborated with Dan Auerbach to revamp what she initially considered to be the completed record. The album saw additional contributions from producers such as Paul Epworth, Greg Kurstin, Daniel Heath, and Rick Nowels, and features a more guitar-based sound than Del Rey's previous releases. Ultraviolence received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the album's lyricism, cohesiveness, production and Del Rey's vocal performance. The album was frequently ranked by various publications as among the best albums of the year as well as the decade, with Metacritic citing it as the 13th-most frequently mentioned album in critics "year-end" lists in 2014.[2] Ultraviolence became a global success, debuting at number one in eleven countries, including the United States with first-week sales of 182,000 copies, becoming the best-selling debut week of Del Rey's career and reached the top five in over twenty territories. After the release of Born to Die in 2012, Del Rey dismissed the idea of releasing another album, because she had "already said everything [she] wanted to say." However, by February 2013, Del Rey had started work on an album saying, "It's a little more stripped down but still cinematic and dark. I've been working on it really slowly but I love everything I've done. I've been writing in Santa Monica and I know what the record sounds like. Now I just have to finish it. Musically I've worked with the same three guys". She mentioned that one of the songs off the album would be called "Black Beauty". When the demo version leaked in July, Del Rey stated "I do feel discouraged, yeah. I don't really know what to put on the record. But I guess I could just put them on and see what happens. Each time I write... I'll never write a song if I don't think it's going to be perfect for the record." She also stated that she was writing "low-key and stripped back" songs and was working with Dan Heath, her then boyfriend Barrie-James O'Neill and that she wanted to work with Lou Reed.</p>
        <h3 id="Honeymoon">Honeymoon</h3>
        <img src="../img/Honeymoon.jpg" alt="Lana Del Rey Honeymoon album cover" width="400" height="400">
        <p>Honeymoon is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. It was released on September 18, 2015, by Polydor Records and Interscope Records, and was produced by Del Rey alongside longtime collaborators Rick Nowels and Kieron Menzies. The album marked a departure from the more guitar-driven instrumentation of Del Rey's previous album Ultraviolence and a return to the baroque pop of Born to Die and Paradise. Lyrically, the album touches on themes of tortured romance, resentment, lust, escapism, and violence. Upon release, Honeymoon received positive reviews from music critics, appearing on the 2015 best albums lists of many publications. At the time of its release, several critics considered the album Del Rey's best album to date.[a] The album was a global success, topping the charts in Australia, Greece, and Ireland and reaching the top five in over twenty countries, including the United States, where it debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 116,000 units in first week. The album was supported by the release of two singles: "High by the Beach", and "Music to Watch Boys To". Musically, Honeymoon has been variously described as a retro-styled work of "grand, cinematic baroque pop",[11] "elegantly melancholy dream pop",[12] and a return to "the cinematic trip hop" of Del Rey's debut album Born to Die[13] and incorporates elements of trap,[14] blues,[15] downtempo pop,[16] and jazz.[17] The album's production was noted as containing sighs, whispers, subtly layered vocals, melodies that lazily unwind, decaying synths, echoing guitar lines, strings, hazes and restrained drum patterns.[18] Built over chopped-and-screwed samples, hints of jazz and Morricone-like soundscapes, Honeymoon has been characterized as Del Rey's most sophisticated album.[17] According to Nick Levine of Time Out, Honeymoon was seen as a departure from the "grungy" tones of Ultraviolence opting for a "glossier" production, which was characterized as containing swirls of cinematic strings, twangy guitars and exquisitely miserable melodies.</p>

        <img src="../img/LustforLife.jpg" alt="Lana Del Rey Lust for Life album cover" width="400" height="400">
        <p>Lust for Life is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, released on July 21, 2017, through Polydor and Interscope Records worldwide and Urban Records in Germany.[2] Marking a return to the "hip-hop inspired" sound of her major-label debut, Lust for Life features production from past collaborators Rick Nowels, Kieron Menzies and Emile Haynie, while also working for the first time with producers Boi-1da, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Metro Boomin. It also features guest appearances from The Weeknd, ASAP Rocky, Stevie Nicks, Sean Lennon, and Playboi Carti.[3] The album and its title were announced on March 29, 2017, through a trailer on Del Rey's official Vevo channel on YouTube. Lust for Life received positive reviews from music critics and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 60th Annual ceremony, becoming Del Rey's second nomination in the category. It appeared on the 2017 year-end best-albums lists from various publications.[5] The album was a global success, topping the charts in twelve counties including the United Kingdom, and United States, while reaching the top five in fifteen territories. Lust for Life mixes numerous music styles. It was described by Stereogum as "Lana Del Rey's version of an A-list pop album, with a big budget and big-name contributors."[14] Its sound was also described as "new-age folk" by Billboard[15] and "trap pop" by Vulture.[16] Rolling Stone defined Lust for Life "her poppiest turn since her debut".[17] The record features recurring trap rhythms, classic rock references, "sepia-toned" orchestral backings, and Del Rey singing with a "hip-hop affectation".[18] The Daily Telegraph stated that the album "lets a bit of light into the darkness of Del Rey's moody past works," noting that "there's a sense of heightened drama in punchy Phil Spector style sixties back beats and the way the heavy timpani criss-crosses with echoing digital trap beats, all swathed in a gauzy haze of Shangri Las style girl group harmonies."[19] The Guardian described the album's sound as "sleek contemporary-sounding soundscapes," and noted "Summer Bummer"'s "eerie production and futuristic melancholy sounding closer to a track from Frank Ocean's Blonde than her usual 50s and 60s enthralled shtick."[20] The A.V. Club praised its modern simplicity, noting that "its beats are subtle hip-hop twitches or electro-pop swells, with percussion redolent of faraway fireworks booms or mellifluous melodic washes."[21] Pitchfork stated that the album "presented alt-pop's quintessential sad girl as actually—could it be?—happy."[22]</p>

        <p>Norman Fucking Rockwell! (abbreviated to NFR! in some releases) is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey released on August 30, 2019, by Polydor and Interscope Records.[1][2] The album was primarily produced by Del Rey and Jack Antonoff, with additional contributions from Zach Dawes, Andrew Watt, and longtime Del Rey collaborator Rick Nowels.[3][4] Musically, Norman Fucking Rockwell! features a soft rock sound consisting of psych-rock songs and piano ballads[5] and features references to various classic rock artists.[6] The title of the album is a reference to painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell. Five singles were released to promote the album: "Mariners Apartment Complex", "Venice Bitch", "Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have - but I Have It", "Doin' Time", and "The Greatest". Lana is known for commenting on pop culture, and on her song "The Greatest", she mentions <a href="https://ericscrivanich.github.io/wa/wa3.html">Kanye West</a> singing, "Kanye West is blonde and gone," referencing West's outward support for Donald Trump. Del Rey embarked on her fifth concert tour, The Norman Fucking Rockwell! Tour, to promote them. It commenced on September 21, 2019, and concluded on November 30, 2019. Norman Fucking Rockwell! received universal acclaim. Music critics praised the album's lyricism, production and Del Rey's musical progression. The album reached number one in seven countries, including the United Kingdom, becoming Del Rey's fourth number one album in the region. In the United States, Norman Fucking Rockwell! peaked at number three, marking Del Rey's fifth consecutive top five album in the country. At the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year, while the title track received a nomination for Song of the Year. Norman Fucking Rockwell! was frequently listed by numerous publications as the best album of 2019, and since its release has been regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 2010s as well as a career highlight for Del Rey. Rolling Stone included the album in their 2020 updated list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[9]FLOOD Magazine described the album's sound as "a mellow soft rock" and noted Del Rey's improved lyrics tackle larger themes than her previous work.[23] According to critics, Norman Fucking Rockwell! features "psych-rock jams" and piano-based ballads.[5][24] Consequence of Sound described the record as featuring "psych-pop lullabies, tales of complicated, consuming romantic love, and overt odes to the tarnished dream of California."[25] It has been characterised as a "pop classic",[26] as well as embodying folk rock,[27][28] and existing somewhere between the desert rock and "minimalist" trip hop of Del Rey's previous efforts.The album features a strong influence from 1970s classic rock.[6] Kitty Empire of The Observer noted that "strings and synth washes soundtrack multiple love songs", and also noted several classic rock references throughout the album, including Neil Young's "Cinnamon Girl", Crosby, Stills, & Nash, and Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy.[30] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the album's "Laurel Canyon '70s soft-rock fantasies", including references to Joni Mitchell and the Eagles. No Ripcord described Norman Fucking Rockwell! as "a remarkably sharp pop record that retains her fascination with pop-culture iconography and the rosey simplicity of a post-war America where classic rock and blue jeans ruled and takes them to much deeper places".</p>

Two singles preceded the album, the title track, "Blue Banisters", and "Arcadia"; "Text Book" and "Wildflower Wildfire" were also released ahead of the album as promotional singles. Blue Banisters peaked at number eight on the US Billboard 200[2] and reached number one in Argentina and the Netherlands.[3] The album received positive reviews from music critics, most of whom complimented Del Rey's introspective lyrics. Musically, Blue Banisters has been described as a folk, pop,[11] jazz,[12][1] and Americana record.[13] It has been described by The A.V. Club lyrically as her "breakup record",[14] while Spin regards it as an "observational project". In a March 2023 interview with Rolling Stone UK, Del Rey explained that Blue Banisters was created due to accusations of cultural appropriation and previous claims that she glamourized domestic abuse: "I was just like, 'Let me try and write an album that maybe could explain why, if that was true, let's say, I could potentially identify with certain modes of operating'. So, Blue Banisters was more of an explanatory album, more of a defensive album, which is why I didn't promote it, period, at all. I didn't want anyone to listen to it. I just wanted it to be there in case anyone was ever curious for any information."</p>
