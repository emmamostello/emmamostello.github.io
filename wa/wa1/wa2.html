        <p>Hello! My name is Emma Mostello, I go by she/her/hers pronouns, and I am Junior here at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am originally from Nashville, Tennessee, but I was born in Colorado, and decided to come back to Colorado for college!</p>
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals for this course is to be able to create my own website and to become better at coding. I am vaguely familiar with coding, I know basic Parthenon and Tableau, but I love the challenge myself and think that this would be a great skill to know and have.</p>
