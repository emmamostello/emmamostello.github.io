        <h1>Page 1 Changes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The html was missing a lang attribute to declare the language so I added a lang attribute on line 2.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Line 24 was not closed as an li, so I closed it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Line 36, Cell 3 was not closed with td so I added a closing tag to it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On line 38, tr was opened and it wasn't closed, so I added a closing tr tag to line 42.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On line 30, the paragraph wasn't closed so I added a closing tag.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>On line 32 a table was opened and was never closed, so I added a closing tag to line 43.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On line 27, the image wasn't displaying properly, so I used ../ in the qoutes to pull up the correct image on the website, while adjusting the size of the image by fixing its height and width. I also moved the link to the website to under the picture using div.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Page 2 Changes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Line 27 the b for bold was never closed so I added a / and a b to make a closing tag.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On line 53 the bold was outside of h2 and I put it on the inside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On line 37, description was put in h3 and I changed it to h2 so all the headers are the same size.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On line 74, the header wasn't closed, I added a closing tag and changed it to h2 so all the headers will be the same size.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The closure section was in h3 so I changed it to h2 so all the headers are the same size.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Under Closure and Interior there were no lines under the header like the rest of the headers, so I added an hr tag.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On line 58, in the a href inside the qoutes there were spaces in "where do I go", so I deleted the spaces.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Page 3 Changes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The start tag was seen without a doctype, so I added a DOCTYPE in line 1.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The html was missing a lang attribute to declare the language so I added a lang attribute on line 1.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The page was missing a title, meta, and link to the css, so I added all three.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The footer kept floating in the middle of the page when the website went live, so I went into the css file and under footer I changed the position from abolute to fixed to make it stay at the bottom of the page while you scroll.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Page 4 Changes</h1>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The start tag was seen without a doctype, so I added a DOCTYPE in line 1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>All of the images were missing an alt attribute so I added alt attributes to all of the images.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>On lines 38 and 43, the td tag was not closed, so I closed it by adding angle brackets and a slash.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Line 48 and 43 did not have a td start tag, so I added one using angle brackets.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When you look at the page on the website, the rows and columns are flipped with cats, dogs, and others in rows instead of columns. I fixed this by making sure all of the dog images were the first line under the tr tag, cats the second, and other the third.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
